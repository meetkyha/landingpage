              I love the idea of being able to just ask a question and get an answer that actually considers my situation. Right now, I have to scroll through a million Google results, and half of them contradict each other.

      <h2 class="fade-in">Who we are</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">Kyha was created by three women who were tired of feeling overlooked in their own health journeys. Like so many others, they were frustrated by conflicting advice, scattered Google searches, and generic apps that didn’t reflect their real needs.</p>
      <p class="fade-in">With backgrounds in health tech and product development, they built Kyha — a smarter, privacy-first companion for gynecological health. It’s built to give you real answers, personalized insights, and trusted guidance, all in one place.</p>
